<h1>Trinity University</h1>

<a href="https://150.trinity.edu/sites/onefifty.trinity.edu/files/captionedimages/northrup-web-1.jpg">Trinity University</a> is located in San Antonio, Texas. Founded in 1869, Trinity recently celebrated its 150th anniversary. For an urban setting campus covering 125 acres, the total undergraduate population is nearly 2,500. Trinity recently reclaimed its ranking in the 2020 edition of Best Colleges as #1 in the Regional Universities West category.</p>

Over 40 percent of the student population takes advantage of the various study abroad programs around the globe. Aside from academics, students can join any of the more than 100 campus organizations.</p>
<p>The features about Trinity that I appreciate most are the small class sizes, friendly student population, and amazing faculty and staff.</p></br>

<p>I chose Trinity University because it is a small, private, liberal arts and sciences institution located in Texas. I grew up in Houston and didn't want to leave Texas, so San Antonio was the perfect location for me because I'm able to visit home occasionally yet remain somewhat independent.</p>
<p>I plan on majoring in Neuroscience because I've always been interested in how the brain works, and I'll be able to apply what I learn at Trinity in medical school. Here are some links to important information about my chosen interest:
